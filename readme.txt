Adds a valid HTML Table of Contents Gutenberg block without JavaScript.

== Description ==

In Gutenberg, add a block and search for "SimpleTOC" or just "TOC". You need to save your post before you add the block. It works by parsing the post content and retrieving the heading blocks and creates a new dynamic block with a list of links to the headings.

Hide the headline "Table of Contents" and set a maximum display depth in the blocks' sidebar configuration. Add the CSS class "simpletoc-hidden" to a heading block to remove that specific heading from the generated TOC.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you do this? =

Because I needed a simple plugin to do this job and decided to do it on his own. I believe that a Table of Contents does not need Javascript and additional css. Furthermore the plugin should work out-of-the-box without any configuration. 

= How do I change the TOC heading ‘Table of contents’ to some other words? =

Hide the headline in the sidebar options of SimpleTOC and add your own heading.

= How do I add SimpleTOC to all articles automatically?  =

I don’t see an easy solution at the moment. SimpleTOC is only a block that can be placed in your post. If there would be a plugin that adds blocks to every post then this would be the solution. I think this should be another separate plug-in to keep the code of SimpleTOC clean and … well, simple. Maybe someone knows of a plug-in that adds blocks automatically to all posts with some parameters and settings? What about site editing in WordPress? I think the core team is working on something like that. I will keep this post open. If I have gained more knowledge how to solve this I will add this feature. 

= How do I add a background color to SimpleTOC? =

SimpleTOC is simple. It will never load JavaScript or CSS. But you can add custom CSS yourself to your theme: 

`.simpletoc {
    padding: 1em 2em;
    background: #bada55;
}`

If you want to add a color including the headline, add a custom css class to the SimpleTOC block. Name it "toctoc" or something like that. 

`.toctoc {
    padding: 1em 1em;
    background: #bada55;
}`

If you use that CSS it will add a colored background to the whole TOC including the heading.

= How do I add smooth scrolling? =

You can optionally add the css class "smooth-scroll" to each link the TOC. Then you can install plugin that uses these classes.
